# Rick and Morty Episodes and Characters

## Project Content

The Netflix serie Rick and Morty's episodes and characters information can
be accessed with this Vue.js project. [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) was used to retrieve all the information.
On the home page, the characters and their information can be seen as cards. By clicking on each character card,
the last episode details of the selected character and list of the characters who were seen
on that episode can be accessed. For pagination, next and prev buttons can be used.
